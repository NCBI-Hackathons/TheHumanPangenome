setup.sh: set up the conda environment for pb-assembly

Once a pb-assembly conda environment is built, you can do `conda activate pb-assembly`
to get all the dependency to run PacBio's FALCON assembler.

In each folder of `H1`, `H2` and `All`, modify the `process_reads.sh` to ger
the proper read files and run it to get `reads.fa` for assembly.

The FALCON assembly can be started with `fc_run fc_run.cfg` in each folder.
